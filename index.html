    <article><h3>Souqs, savannas, safaris and the Sahara – the lure of Africa is its diverse wildlife, thousands of cultures and breathtaking landscapes.</h3>

        Originally meaning ‘to travel’ in Arabic and Swahili, the word ‘safari’ can describe many types of epic adventure in Africa. There’s the ancient Egypt kind – discovering the lost city of Abu Simbel and the Valley of the Kings. The nomadic one – veering away from Morocco’s souqs and medinas and being hosted by a Berber family in the Sahara. 
        The local village version – cherishing moments of interaction with Maasai, San and Malagasy cultures. 
        And, of course, the wildlife way – heading in search of the Big Five in any number of game reserves 
        and parks: Serengeti, Ngorongoro, Kruger and Lake Nakuru, to name a few. What does your African 
        adventure look like?
